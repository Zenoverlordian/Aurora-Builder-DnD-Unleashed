            <p>The ember dwarves fill different roles in different worlds. In most worlds, they are a race of dwarves that were taken from their homes by efreeti after the azer and efreeti stopped their cooperation, in an effort to recreate the azer as loyal servants. In other worlds, ember dwarves are born to normal dwarf parents when latent elemental or fiendish bloodlines activate in the child. There are worlds where some dwarven clans have grown accustomed to a volcanic home by ancient elemental magic, thus turning themselves into ember dwarves.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an ember dwarf, your connection to the elements of fire and earth shines through in your very body. Ember dwarves are often erroneously called half-azer because of their appearance. They have dark, ashen skin, with fiery red or orange hair. When they access the fiery power latent within them, their hair transforms into with vibrant flames that don't burn them or their equipment. They usually have orange, yellow, or red eyes dotted with ashen flecks of black.</p>

            <p>While all dwarves have an innate connection to the stone and rock of the earth, there are some varieties that are more than just connected to it -- they are made of it. The stone dwarves are made of living stone instead of flesh. They still eat, drink, and breathe the way a dwarf of flesh does, and they grow and age the same as other dwarves, but their organs are stone, and they have no blood at all to poison. A stone dwarf's brain is made of electrified copper, and this enables some of them to think more quickly than a brain of flesh.</p>
            <p class="indent">In some of the worlds they inhabit, stone dwarves are the most ancient and purest form of dwarf to have ever existed -- the first dwarves, crafted by the gods of yore, from whom the other subraces of dwarf have all descended. In other worlds, the stone dwarves are descended from ancient clan that was cursed by powerful magic to live as earth elementals. Yet in others, these dwarves are not a hereditary lineage, but they are instead born to dwarven parents at random, considered by some dwarves to be a blessing from the gods, and thought by others to be a terrible curse from the elemental planes.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a stone dwarf, you exist between the realm of dwarf and elemental. Despite their hardened biology and immunity to poisons, stone dwarves are made of brittle and crumbly rock, and aren't much physically tougher than a regular dwarf. They also weigh considerably more than the average dwarf, since their stony flesh is much heavier than regular flesh. They often have moss, vines, or lichen growing where a normal dwarf would grow hair, but otherwise look like living, moving statues carved to resemble normal dwarves.</p>

            <p>In the icy reaches of the world, where hordes of humanoid barbarians rove to hunt massive blubbery beasts and battle the environment itself, the sturdy tundra dwarves can be found eking out a stable life together. Most clans of tundra dwarves live in strongholds of stone or ice within the frozen wastes, often underground, but some make their way as nomads across the tundra, keeping warm with fur tents and animal blubber. In some worlds they live near other dwarves, especially mountain dwarves, but in other worlds tundra dwarves survive on their own.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a tundra dwarf, you owe your heartiness and endurance in the cold to the legacy of your ancestors who first settled in the frozen tundras. Tundra dwarves usually have white or blond hair, but some have orange hair, and brown hair is uncommon but not especially rare. They are slightly tall for dwarves, with mostly pale skin and blue eyes. Some clans of tundra dwarves are exceptions, with mostly tan skin, black or white hair, and brown eyes.</p>
