        <description>
            <p>Your patron is an ancient spellcasting dragon, either a chromatic dragon (black, blue, green, red, or white) or a metallic dragon (brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver). Dragons vary from lawful good to chaotic evil and often have far-reaching, inscrutable goals on account of their extremely long lifespans and great power. Some merely desire agents to help them locate and obtain treasures for their hoard, but most do so for reasons that may only come up once every few decades. Such long periods of inaction are trifling to a dragon. Many ancient dragons have acquired enough magical skill to share their power in a pact. Some aspiring warlocks even make pacts with the dragon goddess Tiamat, making a bargain with one of her five heads in particular and drawing on her power as a dragon rather than as a fiend or goddess.</p>
            <p class="indent">You choose the scales of your dragon, or determine it randomly, using the Dragon Kind table. Each dragon is associated with a damage type and a breath weapon, as shown on the table. The damage type and type of breath weapon used by your patron is referenced by some of the features of this subclass.</p>
