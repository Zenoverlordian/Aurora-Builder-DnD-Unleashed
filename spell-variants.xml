If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to clear the acid, or if some other effect removes the coating (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.</p>

      <p>Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to freeze and cloud with ice. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 cold damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again. If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot above 2nd.</p>

    <description>
      <p>An ash cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the ash cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud).</p>
      <p class="indent">When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A stream of fire rains down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down fire in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.</p>
      <p class="indent">If you are outdoors in extremely hot conditions or beneath volcanic plumes when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing clouds instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You conjure a small cyclone of acid spinning horizontally that floats and sprays as you command in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. The line extends in any direction and originates from any point you can see within range. The acid splashes in a wide arc as it appears, forcing each creature in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">The cyclone provides half-cover to creatures behind it. You can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to move one or both ends of the line to different locations up to 30 feet away that you can see. When you finish moving the area in this way on a turn, you may choose to have the acid splash again, forcing all creatures in the area to repeat the Dexterity saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">The cyclone lasts until the spell ends, at which point it vanishes. If at any time you aren't within range of at least one end of the line, the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the acid damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

Each creature that is directly above one of the locations must make a Dexterity saving throw, as beams of light shoot around them.

The prisons shed a bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The insides of the light cages are searing to flesh and form.

			<p>You inflict a magical disease on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become charmed by you after 12 hours and for the duration of the spell. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell. You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it, as well as any spell that cures disease.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.</p>

			<p>An amber globe of sound energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. The explosion can be heard from up to 1 mile away. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 thunder damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Any nonmagical objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take half the spell's damage. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, humming softly, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It explodes on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without detonating it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already detonated, it explodes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th

                <li>You can move through other creatures' spaces, and you can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling, but only on your turns.</li>
                <li>When you move into a creature's space for the first time on one ofyour turns, that creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure , it takes 6d4 radiant damage and is knocked prone. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.

                <li>When you move across the ground on your turn, you leave footsteps that shine with searing light in your wake that last until the end ofyour next turn. The path is as wide as your space and reaches 5 feet high. When another creature ends its turn within the trail, it takes 4d4 radiant damage.</li>

        <p>A bead of highly compressed crystals condenses to linger at a chosen point within range for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead explodes into a blast of jagged shards. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6. If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in a sharp burst. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.</p>
        <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>

        <p>A beam of intense white light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a high-pitched scream into an explosion of intense light. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6. If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in a flash of light. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.</p>
        <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>

        <supports>Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You beckon an elemental comet to descend from above and strike the ground in a freezing explosion at a point you can see within range. Each creature within a 30-foot sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 cold damage and 3d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">After impact, the frozen comet lurches out of its crater, awakens, and separates into an ice elemental and a fog elementaL each of which disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. Each of the elementals takes bludgeoning damage equal to half its maximum hit points from the impact. Creatures in the ice elemental's space are pushed away from the center of the impact point until they are completely outside the elemental's space.</p>
            <p class="indent">The elementals are friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elementals, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elementals,they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions .</p>
            <p class="indent">If your concentration is broken, the elementals don't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elementals, they become hostile toward you and your companions, and they might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The DM has the elementals' statistics. This spell deals double damage to objects and structures in the area of the comet's impact. Additionally, ground within the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>

The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. The cloud sheds dim light in a 40-foot radius When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p>

			<p>A massive foamy wave of transparent acid sprays in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 acid damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Constructs and elementals have disadvantage on this saving throw.  A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.  The spell deals damage to objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>

            <p>You are surrounded by a swirling shield of boiling lava that doesn't damage you or your equipment. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have resistance to cold damage.</li>
                <li>You can't be restrained by nonmagical objects.</li>
                <li>Any creature that grapples you or begins its turn while grappling you takes 12d4 fire damage.</li>
                <li>Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you makes a melee attack against you, the creature has disadvantage on the attack, and it takes 8d4 fire damage before the attack hits or misses.</li>
                <li>When you are attacked with a weapon, the attack misses and the swirling lava consumes the weapon, melting it and destroying it. If ammunition was used, it is consumed instead. This doesn't happen if the weapon is magical or a natural weapon, or if the attack used magical ammunition.</li>

        <description>
            <p>When you cast this spell, the ground within 60 feet of a point that you choose within range is transformed into incredibly caustic and sticky acidic slime that extends 5 feet deep until the spell ends. A creature walking on the slime must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. Each creature that touches the slime for the first time on a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, unless it is already restrained by the slime. On a failed save, it takes 8d6 acid damage and is restrained by the slime. On a success, it takes half damage and it isn't restrained</p>
            <p class="indent">Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the slime or enters that area for the first time on a turn takes 4d6 acid damage, or 12d6 acid damage if it is restrained by the slime. When a restrained creature ends its turn, it sinks into the slime. In addition, whenever a creature falls prone within the slime or ends its turn while prone within the slime, it takes 8d6 additional acid damage and sinks into the slime. This spell treats creatures that cannot be prone as if they are always prone instead</p>
            <p class="indent">A restrained creature can use an action to attempt to escape. It makes a Strength check against your spell save DC, with disadvantage if it has sunk into the slime. On a success, it frees itself and stands atop the slime.</p>
            <p class="indent">The slime damages objects in the area and it flows downhill and through holes or channels (at the DM's discretion). When the spell ends, the slime cools and hardens into a soft, gelatinous surface. The surface is broken wherever a creature would be trapped inside.</p>

            <p>You conjure a massive orb of opaque golden fire with a diameter of 20 feet at a point that you can see within range. It crashes into the ground then rolls up to 100 feet in a straight line to an unoccupied space. The orb sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for an additional 100 feet. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried as well as those that touch the orb.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each creature in the orb's space when it appears or in its path when it rolls must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d12 fire damage and be knocked prone. For the duration, you can use an action on your turn if you are within range of the orb to push it with magic, causing it to roll up to 100 feet in a straight line to an unoccupied space again.</p>
            <p class="indent">The orb deals double damage to objects, but it can't roll through an object unless it deals enough damage to destroy the object. If the orb finishes its movement on an incline, it may roll downhill at the end of that turn (at the DM's discretion), rolling each turn until you use an action to roll it again or it reaches level ground.</p>

            <p>You emit a massive beam of roaring, turbulent flame from your throat in a line 500 feet long and 25 feet wide that blasts away all in its destructive path.

On a success, a creature takes halfas much damage and is not pushed or knocked prone.</p>

            <p>You evoke a whip-like cord of searing arcane light and magical force in your free hand The whip sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet and lasts for the duration. If you let go of the whip, it disappears, but you can evoke the whip again as a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use your action to lash out with the whip, which stretches and weaves between foes. Up to five targets of your choice that you can see within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 5d8 radiant damage and 5d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Objects automatically fail the saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">Damage from this spell ignores resistance, and it ignores immunity to radiant damage when dealing damage to objects.</p>
