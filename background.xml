        <description>
            <p>You grew up within a community that took special effort to keep itself isolated and hidden from the outside world, so that even the most accurate ofmaps don't mark its location, and the most learned of scholars have never heard of it. You learned from a young age that you must keep your home a secret, which involves not only camouflaging the village itself, but also watching for intruders nearby and concealing your movements when you travel outside your home.</p>
            <p class="indent">This background is common among pixies, sprites, green elves, miniature elves, stone dwarves, and jungle halflings, along with other races such as firbolgs and tritons.</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Perception, Stealth</li>
                <li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One gaming set known only to your village, and your choice of navigator's tools or herbalism kit.</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A waterskin, a tinderbox, a gaming set (one of your choice), a lamp, a bedroll, a set of traveler's clothes, a trinket to reminds you of home, and a gemstone worth 10 gp</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>LOCATION</h5>
            <p>The location of your hidden community and the nature of its camouflage help to define your upbringing. You can roll on the following table to determine the location of your hidden village, or choose one that best fits your character.</p>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>Life within a secluded community has a unique impact on your characteristics. You have been taught to live as an isolationist. Your mannerisms, ideas, equipment, and even the way you speak may stand out from the crowd to others in the outside world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Use the tables for the folk hero or outlander background in the Player 's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a person from a shrouded isolationist community. For example, if you are using the folk hero tables, you might change references to your homeland to fit with the nature of your secluded lifestyle and location.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You have traveled across the planes to come to your current location, encountering wonders and perils along the way. You might have grown up in another plane, or perhaps you spent a long time away from home in another plane. You could have fallen into a strange portal and searched constantly for a way home, or you might have gone exploring intentionally. Regardless of the reasons for your planar travels, they have shaped you into the adventurer that you are today.</p>
            <p class="indent">This background is common among crystalkin, bright elves, ember dwarves, and stone dwarves, along with other races such as genasi, aarakocra, and tieflings.</p>

                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A bedroll, a waterskin, a 10-foot pole, 50-feet of silk rope, a steel mirror, a piece of a broken metal tuning fork used for the plane shift spell that was attuned to the Material Plane, a trinket from another plane, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing two gemstones each worth 10 gp</li>

            <p>Though you have traveled far, you once spent a great deal of time in a particular plane or realm, growing familiar with it. You can roll on the following table to determine the plane or realm that you spent so much time in, or choose one that best fits your character.</p>

            <p>Your journey across the planes has informed much of your current personality because of its difficulty. Your personality traits are also likely responsible for some of your journey -- only certain kinds of people seek to make this perilous trek across the planes as you have.</p>
            <p class="indent">Use the tables for the sage or hermit background in the Player 's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as someone who has ventured across the planes to reach your current location. For example, if you are using the hermit tables, you might change any mention of your seclusion to be your reason for traveling the planes.</p>
