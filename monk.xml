            <p>The Way of the Flying Fist teaches that true martial power is found in the air, when one escapes from the pull of gravity. Monks of this Way train their bodies to leap great heights, channel that power into their strikes, and even pursue the ancient techniques that enable them to fly through the air.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can grapple a willing creature without making an attack, an ability check, or using an action, and when you spend a ki point to use the Step of the Wind feature, you can carry a creature you are grappling your full speed instead of half your speed.</p>

            <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to channel the force of your mighty leaps into your attacks. When you spend a ki point to use the Step of the Wind feature, your jump distance is tripled instead of doubled.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use the Step of the Wind feature and jump or fly at least 10 feet toward a target, you can change the first attack you make against it at the end of the movement into a leaping strike. On a hit, the attack deals bonus damage equal to two of your Martial Arts dice + twice your Dexterity modifier, and you can choose to spend 1 extra ki point. If you do, the target must make a Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure. You can only make a leaping strike with a monk weapon or an unarmed strike, and you can only do so once per turn.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, you can intercept a foe when they move. When a creature moves within 15 feet of you, you can spend 1 ki point and use your reaction to jump (or fly if you have a flying speed) up to 15 feet to a space adjacent to them. If you do, you make an unarmed attack against the creature immediately at the end of the movement. If you hit, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.</p>

            <p>Starting at 11th level, you have advantage on saving throws and ability checks to avoid or escape a grapple or to avoid becoming restrained, and you never require more than 10 feet of movement to stand up when prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">Also, you can move through enemy spaces on any turn you have dodged or disengaged, but you can't end your turn there.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, difficult terrain never costs you more than 2 feet of speed for every 1 feet of movement, and when you spend a ki point to use the Step of the Wind feature, you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your turn.</p>

            <p>Starting at 17th level, you have mastered the Flying Fist's ultimate art: becoming weightless and walking on air itself. You have a base flying speed of 60 feet and you can hover. The bonus damage of your Leaping Strike also increases to four of your Martial Arts dice + twice your Dexterity modifier.</p>
