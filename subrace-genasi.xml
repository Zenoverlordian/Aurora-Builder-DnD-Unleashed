            <p>As an ash genasi, you have manifested both earth and fire, connecting you with the deathly dual-element of ash, the dead flames. Your mood gravitates toward dourness, and you tend to take on a more pessimistic perspective than others.</p>
            <p class="indent">Ash genasi have gray skin tones that range from nearly charcoal black to a pale, almost bone-white color, which is almost constantly flaky and ashy. Their hair is usually a dark red or orange, but some rare ash genasi have smoldering flames instead of hair, which never grow very long or very intense, and baldness is very common among ash genasi. Many ash genasi also smell of smoke and burnt hair.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ashen Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to fire damage and necrotic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Awaken the Ashes.</em></strong> You know the control flames cantrip, but you can only use it to extinguish flames and create simple shapes. You can also cast the fog cloud spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>

            <p>As an ice genasi, you have manifested both air and water, connecting you with the enduring dual-element of ice, water that has been robbed of its heat. You are nearly emotionless, except when pushed to anger or grief, which you feel very rarely and only in the worst of situations.</p>
            <p class="indent">Ice genasi have pale skin made out of a fragile, flexible crystal, usually a cloudy white or bluish-white, but sometimes a vibrant blue-black color instead. They are a bit larger than humans on average and cold to the touch, often developing condensation water upon their skin just by existing. Many ice genasi have blue, black, or white hair, usually of a very soft and fine texture, but others have rigid crystals sprouting from their head instead of hair, with no hair anywhere upon their body. Ice genasi have blue eyes, but they vary in shades from nearly white to deep indigo.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Invocation of Ice.</em></strong> You can cast armor of agathys with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the new ice sculpture spell with it, and starting at 5th level, you can also cast sleet storm with it. Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>

You live by concealing your feelings behind a graceful mask, appearing to feel whatever emotion is most convenient for a situation, but those who know you well have seen your true emotions slip out, which are often acrid, bitter, and caustic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Slime genasi have bright green or greenish-yellow skin, often seeming sickly or jaundiced to those who don't know of their existence as a subrace. Except for a short period after bathing, their skin is always covered in a thin layer of transparent slime. Slime genasi usually have green, dark green, or black hair, but sometimes have white, blond, or even purple hair, with similar variations in eye color.</p>

You are passionate and boisterous, moving swiftly from friendly eagerness to raging anger or bitter sorrow and back to calm optimism or certain determination more quickly than others might think possible. Unlike an air genasi, your emotional storms can last for days on end.</p>
            <p class="indent">Storm genasi have skin of deep blue or sometimes shades of bluish purple or grey. Their hair, which is usually a dark color but can sometimes be stark white, is always standing up because of the static charge that suffuses their body at all times.
