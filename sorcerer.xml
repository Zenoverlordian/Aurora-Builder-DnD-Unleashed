            <p>Your innate magic is that of the far reaches of the Astral Plane and the Far Realm beyond it, that of the stars, the sun, the moon, and the old things that glide through the dark. Your magical gifts shift through cycles of burning radiance and freezing void just as the cosmos itself does. Perhaps you were born under an auspicious star or eldritch constellation. You might be the descendant of a powerful warlock who drew magic from a distant star, or you might have been exposed to the strange magic of the cosmos directly.</p>

            <p>Also at 1st level, you embody the cosmic power of the sun and moon, but only one of them at a time. Choose either the lunar or solar phase. You begin in this phase, and you are always in one phase or the other. After you cast a spell that deals radiant damage, you automatically switch phases at the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can choose to switch phases when you finish a short or long rest and after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher that doesn't deal radiant damage. You can also use a bonus action on your turn and spend 1 sorcery point to switch phases. You can't switch phases more than once per turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">The two phases grant you different benefits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Lunar.</em></strong> When you enter the lunar phase, you can choose to emit a cloud of icy dust extending 10 feet out from you that stays centered on you. The area is lightly obscured, and lasts until you enter the solar phase or use a bonus action on your turn to end the effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">After you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher that deals cold or radiant damage while you're in the lunar phase, you gain an orbiting lunar ward that lasts for 1 minute or until you enter the solar phase. If you are attacked before then, you roll 1d4 and apply the result as a penalty to the attack roll, and the ward disappears. You can't have more than one lunar ward at once.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Solar.</em></strong> When you enter the solar phase, you can shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for 15 feet beyond that until you enter the lunar phase or use a bonus action on your turn to end the light.</p>
            <p class="indent">After you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire or radiant damage while you're in the solar phase, you can emit a solar flare, dealing 2 fire damage to one creature that you can see within 15 feet of you. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p>

            <p>You manifest magic of the four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. Your magic could be the result of at least one genie in your ancestry, emerging as magical power instead of (or in addition to) making you a genasi. It could be the result of a journey through the Elemental Planes that infused you with magic. Or perhaps you even absorbed an elemental's power in an eldritch ritual.</p>
            <p class="indent">You might wield the power of only one of the four elements, or you might pursue all four nearly equally. Every elemental sorcerer begins with a natural talent for one element. Some choose to focus on that element exclusively, while others spend their careers gradually learning how to use all four elements.</p>

            <p class="indent">If you don't know the chosen cantrip, you learn it, and it doesn't count against the number of cantrips you can learn as a sorcerer. This spell can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class. If you already know the cantrip, it becomes more powerful for you instead: the range of the spell is increased by 30 feet for you.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you reach 10th level, then again at 14th level, you choose a cantrip from the list again. You can choose a new cantrip or the same cantrip again. The effects are the same, and the increases to range are cumulative. If you choose the same cantrip all three times, distances within the spell's description are also tripled for you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can change up to one of the decisions you made for this feature.</p>

            <p>Also at 1st level, you know how to make the most of your connection to plants. When you cast the thorn whip or razor leaf cantrips, you roll the same number of damage dice as normal, but they are d10s instead of d6s.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast the new leaf shield spell, you are considered proficient with the shield you create while you are wielding it without using any hands.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, you have advantage on ability checks made to cultivate or tend to plants or to socially interact with plant creatures.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to plant magic seeds in the wounds of your enemies to sprout into sorcery.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you deal a creature force, necrotic, piercing, poison, or slashing damage using a sorcerer spell, you can pay 1 sorcery point to plant a hidden magical seed in the creature that lasts until you finish a long rest. While a creature is seeded by you, you cannot plant any additional magical seeds in it.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can choose one creature that you have seeded, causing the seed to sprout from its body and bloom into magic. You cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action, expending spell slots and requiring components as normal, but the spell is cast from the seed's location instead of your own.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the spell targets creatures, you must include the seeded creature as a target, and if it targets a point or location, it must target the seeded creature's location. If the spell normally requires you to see the target, you can ignore that requirement. If you make a spell attack against the target as part of the spell, the attack ignores AC bonuses granted by shields, cover, and disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the seeded creature is in sunlight when you sprout its spell seed, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you learn to restore your body by drawing power from nature as plants do. You can use a bonus action and spend 1 to 5 sorcery points while you are within bright light or a body of water, regaining 3d6 hit points for each sorcery point spent. Either the light must be sunlight, or the water must be clean enough to see through and not acidic enough to deal damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Also, when you take a short rest in such a place, you can regain a number of hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, you can feed yourself for a day without eating anything by staying in both sunlight and clean water at the same time for at least 1 hour.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 18th level, you can use an action on your turn to plant a magical tree in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The tree grows instantly to full size: its trunk is 3 feet in diameter and occupies its space, and the tree is up to 20 feet tall, but obstacles can constrain its height. The tree glows with magic and it is immune to damage, but it is still a physical object. It is tangible, it provides cover, it can be climbed, etc.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the tree appears, you can imbue the tree with one sorcerer spell you know of 5th-level or lower, but you must spend sorcery points equal to the spell's level to do so. The spell must target only one creature and it can’t be a cantrip or have a range of Self.</p>
            <p class="indent">The tree lasts for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), and it provides the following benefits for the duration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The tree sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</li>
                <li>Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the tree has advantage on saving throws against spells and on any spell attacks it makes using a cantrip.</li>
                <li>If you imbued the tree with a spell, each creature of your choice that enters the area within 30 feet of the tree for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there becomes affected by the imbued spell as if you had cast the spell on it, requiring no concentration. The spell ends immediately on the creature when it is no longer within 30 feet of the tree.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.</p>
